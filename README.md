#RegressionModelCarbonMetrics

ðŸ“Š Project Overview

RegressionModelCarbonMetrics predicts COâ‚‚ emissions using vehicle fuel consumption and engine data. The project leverages Linear Regression with both numerical and categorical features, providing accurate environmental insights.

Dataset: fuel_consumption_dataset.csv

Features: Engine size, cylinders, fuel consumption, transmission type, fuel type

Target: CO2EMISSIONS (g/km)

ðŸ§© Workflow

Data Preparation

Selected numerical features: ENGINESIZE, CYLINDERS, FUELCONSUMPTION_COMB

Selected categorical features: TRANSMISSION, FUELTYPE

One-hot encoded categorical features

Standardized numerical features for better scaling

Train-Test Split

80% training, 20% testing

Model Training

Applied Linear Regression on combined numerical + encoded categorical features

Model coefficients reveal feature contributions to COâ‚‚ emissions

Evaluation

Metrics calculated on the test set:

MAE: 3.27 g/km

MSE: 24.81 gÂ²/kmÂ²

RMSE: 4.98 g/km

RÂ² Score: 0.994 â€” extremely accurate prediction

Visualization

Scatter plot comparing actual vs predicted COâ‚‚ emissions:

plt.figure(figsize=(8,6))
plt.scatter(y_test, y_pred, color='darkcyan', alpha=0.7)
plt.plot([y.min(), y.max()], [y.min(), y.max()], 'r--', linewidth=2)
plt.xlabel("Actual CO2 Emissions (g/km)")
plt.ylabel("Predicted CO2 Emissions (g/km)")
plt.title("Actual vs Predicted CO2 Emissions")
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()

ðŸ“ˆ Results
Metric	Value
Mean Absolute Error (MAE)	3.27
Mean Squared Error (MSE)	24.81
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)	4.98
RÂ² Score	0.994

The scatter plot demonstrates an almost perfect fit along the y=x line.

ðŸš€ Insights

Fuel consumption is the strongest predictor of COâ‚‚ emissions.

Transmission and fuel type also contribute, but numerical features dominate.

This model can help automotive engineers and policymakers monitor and reduce carbon footprints efficiently.
